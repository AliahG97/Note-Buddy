## Features

1. New Note: User can click "start", which navigates to the browser page to enter a new note title, and the new note details below.

2. Save note: Once the user clicks "save", the note is added to the data base json file. This way the note remains in saved notes on the browser even if the browser is refreshed or the cache is cleared.

3. Update notes: Everytime a note is added or deleted, the database json file is updated, by rewriting all the existing data, and omitting deleted data.

4. Delete notes: Every new note is assigned a unique id, so that when the user clicks the trash can on a note, it will only delete that specific note based on its specific unique id. 

## Usage
Note Buddy is ideal for anyone who want to keep track of their daily "to-do" tasks, on a simple and professional interface that ensures the data is saved at all times, and remains up to date.
